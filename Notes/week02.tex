\subsection{Importance of Linearity}

Linearity of the objective function is important since it restricts the solutions to the vertices of the feasible region. Even when alternative solutions exist along and edge, at least one vertex will always be an optimal solution. This property simplifies the search for optimal solutions, as algorithms can focus on evaluating vertices rather than the entire feasible region.

\subsection{Defining Objectives}
Sometimes the solutions are constrained only by the constraints and not by the objective function. Since solutions will always lie in the vertices of the feasible region, we can end up in situations where the objective function is irrelevant, since there is perhaps only one existing vertex. In these cases, the objective function can be defined arbitrarily, as it will not affect the solution.
